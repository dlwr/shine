# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SHINE is a comprehensive movie database project designed to be the world's most organized movie database. It collects and organizes movie information, awards, nominations, and multilingual translations. The project is built on Cloudflare Workers with Turso (libSQL) database and uses a modular architecture with separate packages for API, scrapers, database, and frontend.

## Architecture

The project uses a simplified monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces:

- **api/** - Hono-based REST API running on Cloudflare Workers
- **scrapers/** - CLI-based data collection tools (Wikipedia, TMDb, Cannes Film Festival, Academy Awards)
- **front/** - Astro-based frontend (Cloudflare Pages)
- **src/** - Shared database schemas, migrations, and utilities

Key design patterns:

- Date-seeded movie selection (daily/weekly/monthly) with deterministic hash-based randomization, persisted in database
- Multilingual support through a flexible translations table
- Comprehensive awards and nominations tracking system
- UUID-based primary keys with snake_case database naming
- Database: Turso (libSQL) - a SQLite-compatible edge database

## Common Commands

## Database Schema

The core entities follow this relationship structure:

```
movies ←→ translations (movie titles/descriptions)
  ↓ 1:N     ↓ 1:N
nominations  movie_selections (daily/weekly/monthly picks)
  ↓ N:1         ↓ 1:N
award_categories  poster_urls
  ↓ N:1
award_organizations
  ↓ 1:N
award_ceremonies
```

Important schema details:

- All tables use UUID primary keys generated by `generateUUID()` utility
- **`translations` table structure**:
  - `resourceType` must be `"movie_title"` for movie titles (NOT `"movie"`)
  - `content` field contains the raw title text directly (NOT formatted like `"title:Movie Name"`)
  - Composite unique constraint on `(resourceType, resourceUid, languageCode)`
  - Movie titles are NOT stored in the movies table itself - they must be in translations
- Database uses snake_case naming convention (configured in drizzle.config.ts)
- Date-seeded movie selection uses deterministic hash-based algorithms with persistence in `movie_selections` table

## Database Configuration

The project uses Turso (libSQL) as the database with separate databases for development and production. Configuration requires:

**Development Environment:**

- `TURSO_DATABASE_URL`: Your development Turso database URL
- `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your development Turso authentication token

**Production Environment:**

- `TURSO_DATABASE_URL_PROD`: Your production Turso database URL
- `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN_PROD`: Your production Turso authentication token

**Admin Authentication:**

- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Admin password for login
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token generation (uses `jose` library)

**External APIs (for scrapers):**

- `TMDB_API_KEY`: TMDb API key for movie data
- `TMDB_LEAD_ACCESS_TOKEN`: TMDb access token
- `OMDB_API_KEY`: OMDb API key for additional movie data

For local development with Cloudflare Workers:

1. Copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` in the root directory
2. Add your Turso credentials and API keys
3. The `.dev.vars` file is automatically symlinked to `api/` and `scrapers/` directories
4. Environment variables are loaded automatically by wrangler during development

For production deployment, set secrets using:

```bash
wrangler secret put TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN_PROD --env production
wrangler secret put ADMIN_PASSWORD --env production
wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET --env production
```

## Data Collection Strategy

Scrapers are CLI-based tools that run locally and follow this priority order:

1. Wikipedia (primary source for basic info and awards)
2. TMDb (The Movie Database - for Japanese translations and poster URLs)
3. Cannes Film Festival (official selections and awards)
4. Academy Awards (Oscar nominations and wins)
5. OMDb (planned for additional movie data)

Scraping features:

- Cheerio for HTML parsing with error handling and retry logic
- Command-line arguments support (e.g., specific year for Cannes scraper)
- Incremental updates to avoid duplicate data
- Integration with TMDb API for enriched movie data
- Automatic poster URL and translation fetching

## API Design

The main API endpoint (`/`) returns date-seeded movie selections:

- Daily: Changes every day
- Weekly: Changes every Friday (week starts Friday)
- Monthly: Changes every month

Movie selection features:

- Hash-based seeding ensures deterministic but varied results
- Selections are persisted in the `movie_selections` table
- Existing selections are reused to maintain consistency
- Fallback to hash-based selection if no movies match criteria

### Public API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Get date-seeded movie selections (daily/weekly/monthly)
- `GET /movies/:id` - Get movie details with all translations

### Admin API Endpoints

Authentication is handled via JWT tokens (using `jose` library) stored in localStorage (client-side only):

- `POST /auth/login` - Login with admin password
- `GET /admin/movies` - List all movies (paginated)
- `POST /movies/:id/translations` - Add or update movie translation
- `DELETE /movies/:id/translations/:lang` - Delete movie translation
- `DELETE /admin/movies/:id` - Delete movie and all related data (nominations, translations, posters, selections)
- `PUT /admin/movies/:id/imdb-id` - Update IMDb ID with optional TMDb data refresh
- `POST /admin/movies/:id/posters` - Add poster URL to movie
- `DELETE /admin/movies/:movieId/posters/:posterId` - Delete poster from movie
- `POST /reselect` - Force new movie selection for a specific period

### Admin Frontend Routes

Admin interface pages (authentication required via localStorage token):

- `/admin/login` - Admin login page
- `/admin/movies` - Movies list with pagination
- `/admin/movies/:id` - Edit movie details and translations

Note: Authentication uses localStorage, not cookies, so server-side auth checks in Astro pages won't work.

## Code Style and Conventions

- TypeScript with strict configuration
- ESLint with recommended + strict + unicorn rules
- Prettier for formatting with import organization
- No comments in code unless explicitly requested
- Follow existing patterns for database queries and API responses
- Use existing utilities and libraries (Hono, Drizzle, Cheerio)

- Added movie_selections table documentation
- Updated scraper commands (TMDb, Cannes Film Festival integration)
- Fixed environment variable names (removed \_DEV suffix)
- Added missing API endpoints documentation
- Updated file paths to match current structure
- Added `pnpm run dev` command to start both API and frontend concurrently

### 2025-06-10

- Improved `/admin/movies` page with better sorting and poster display:
  - Changed default sort order to `created_at DESC` (newest movies first)
  - Modified poster display to show only one poster per movie instead of multiple
- Added movie deletion functionality:
  - New `DELETE /admin/movies/:id` API endpoint with cascading delete of all related data
  - Added delete button with confirmation dialog in admin movies list
  - Proper cleanup of movie_selections, nominations, translations, and poster_urls
- Fixed `/admin/movies` API endpoint bug:
  - Corrected SQL ORDER BY clause to use proper camelCase column name `createdAt` instead of snake_case `created_at`
  - Used SQL template with schema field reference: `sql`${movies.createdAt} DESC`` at api/src/index.ts:581

### 2025-06-10 (Updated)

- Fixed API URL handling inconsistency:
  - Standardized all API URL construction to NOT include trailing slash in base URL
  - All API paths must start with leading slash (e.g., `/auth/login`, `/reselect`)
  - Fixed `Movies.astro` and `wrangler.jsonc` to follow this pattern
  - This prevents URL construction errors like `http://localhost:8787reselect`
- Fixed `/reselect` endpoint:
  - The endpoint expects `type` parameter, not `period`
  - Request body should include both `type` and `locale`
- Fixed movie import script (`movie-import-from-list.ts`):
  - Corrected `resourceType` to use `"movie_title"` instead of `"movie"`
  - Fixed `content` field to store raw title text instead of formatted strings
  - Resolved all ESLint errors (non-null assertions, null vs undefined, unused variables)

### 2025-06-11

- Fixed Cloudflare Pages deployment environment variable issues:
  - Environment variables in Cloudflare Pages must be set in `wrangler.jsonc` under `vars` section, not as secrets
  - Astro components can access runtime environment variables via `Astro.locals?.runtime?.env`
  - For fallback compatibility, use pattern: `runtimeEnv?.VAR || import.meta.env.VAR || "default"`
  - Secrets and vars cannot coexist with the same name - delete secrets if using vars
  - `front/src/components/Movies.astro:11-12` shows proper environment variable access pattern
- Fixed movie import nomination assignment bug:
  - Movie import scripts were incorrectly assigning all nominations to Cannes Film Festival
  - Root cause: Database lookups for categories and ceremonies didn't filter by `organizationUid`
  - Fixed `scrapers/src/movie-import-from-list.ts` and `scrapers/src/academy-awards.ts` to use compound WHERE clauses
  - Now properly filters by both identifying field AND `organizationUid` using `and()` condition
  - This ensures nominations are assigned to the correct award organization

### 2025-06-11 (Article Links Feature)

- Added article links feature for user-submitted movie-related articles:
  - New `article_links` table with spam/flagging support and rate limiting

  - Dedicated movie detail pages (`/movies/[id]`) for article submission
  - Admin spam flagging functionality via `POST /admin/article-links/:id/spam`
- Implemented mobile-responsive collapsible content:
  - Nominations, article links, and add article button are collapsible on mobile (≤768px)
  - Always expanded on desktop (>768px)
  - Smooth animations with toggle button and icons
- **Removed view counting feature completely**:
  - Removed `viewCount` column from `article_links` table
  - Removed `/article-links/:id/view` API endpoint
  - Articles now sorted by `submittedAt DESC` instead of view count
  - Cleaner UI without view count displays

### 2025-06-11 (Japan Academy Awards Scraper Implementation)

- Successfully implemented Japan Academy Awards scraper from consolidated Wikipedia page:
  - **Source**: Uses `https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/日本アカデミー賞作品賞` (consolidated awards page)
  - **Coverage**: Extracts 159 movies across years 1978-2024 (missing: 1979, 1989, 1999, 2009, 2019)
  - **Year detection**: Multi-pattern approach (`YYYY年（第X回）`, `第X回`, `YYYY年`) with ceremony calculation `1976 + X = year`
  - **Duplicate prevention**: Implemented `processedYears` Set to avoid processing same year multiple times
  - **2024 special handling**: Extracts movies from text format rather than table (5 nominees: 侍タイムスリッパー, キングダム 大将軍の帰還, 正体, 夜明けのすべて, ラストマイル)
- **CLI Integration**: Full support for `--year`, `--dry-run`, `--seed` options

  - `pnpm run scrapers:japan-academy-awards --year 2024` (specific year)
  - `pnpm run scrapers:japan-academy-awards --dry-run` (safe testing)

### 2025-06-11 (Movie Deletion Foreign Key Fix)

- Fixed critical foreign key constraint error in movie deletion API:
  - **Root cause**: `reference_urls` table deletion was missing from cascading delete logic
  - **Solution**: Added `referenceUrls` deletion to movie delete endpoint at `api/src/index.ts:665-668`
  - **Complete deletion order**: article_links → movie_selections → nominations → reference_urls → translations → poster_urls → movies
  - **Prevention**: Added comprehensive guidelines for foreign key constraint handling in Development Guidelines
- **Lesson learned**: Always verify ALL foreign key references across entire schema when implementing delete operations
- **Key insight**: Most tables lack `onDelete: 'cascade'` configuration, requiring manual cascading delete implementation

### Development Guidelines

- TSエラーとLintエラーをを絶対に無視するな
- Database column names in schema use camelCase (e.g., `createdAt`, `updatedAt`) but are mapped to snake_case in the actual database
- When writing SQL queries, use the schema field references directly instead of hardcoding column names
- **API URL Convention**: Base URLs should NOT have trailing slashes, paths should start with leading slash
- **Cloudflare Pages Environment Variables**: Use `vars` in wrangler.jsonc, access via `Astro.locals?.runtime?.env` in components
- **API URL Handling**: Always use `getApiUrl(Astro.locals)` utility from `front/src/utils/api.ts` instead of manual environment variable handling
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Consider mobile-first design with collapsible content for dense information
- **Security**: Always implement rate limiting for public submission endpoints
- **TailwindCSS**: Use utility-first approach, preserve custom CSS only for complex animations/interactions
- **Component Styling**: Follow responsive patterns like `text-xl md:text-2xl` and `p-5 md:p-6`
- **Favicon Management**: Use ImageMagick to generate multiple favicon formats from source assets; maintain 16x16, 32x32, ICO, and Apple touch icon variants
- **Database Foreign Key Constraints and Cascading Deletes**:
  - **Critical**: When implementing delete operations for core entities (movies, awards, etc.), always verify ALL foreign key references across the entire schema
  - Most tables do NOT have `onDelete: 'cascade'` configured, requiring manual deletion of related data
  - **Movie deletion order**: article_links → movie_selections → nominations → reference_urls → translations → poster_urls → movies
  - Use `Task` tool to search all schema files for foreign key references when implementing new delete operations
  - Test delete operations in development to catch missing cascading delete logic before production
- **Wikipedia Scraping Best Practices**:
  - Use duplicate prevention logic (`Set<T>`) when processing tables to avoid year/data duplication
  - Implement multiple year detection patterns for robustness (`YYYY年（第X回）`, `第X回`, `YYYY年`)
  - Handle special cases where data appears in text format rather than tables (e.g., 2024 Japan Academy Awards)
  - Always include comprehensive error handling and skip logic for malformed/irrelevant tables
  - Remove debug output before production; keep only essential operational logs
- **Admin Interface Development**:
  - Always include proper TypeScript types for API responses to avoid runtime errors
  - Use modal-based UI patterns for complex form interactions (IMDb ID, poster management)
  - Implement comprehensive form validation both client and server-side
  - Provide immediate user feedback for all operations (success/error messages)
  - Use grid layouts for visual content management (poster thumbnails)
  - Implement confirmation dialogs for destructive operations (delete)
- **TMDb API Integration Best Practices**:
  - Always use existing TMDb utility functions from `scrapers/src/common/tmdb-utilities.ts`
  - Implement graceful fallbacks when TMDb data is unavailable
  - Log essential operations but remove debug output for production
  - Use consistent error handling patterns across TMDb API calls
